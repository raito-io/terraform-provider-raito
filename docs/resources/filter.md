## Schema

### Required

- `data_source` (String) The ID of the data source of the filter
- `filter_policy` (String) The filter policy that defines how the data is filtered. The policy syntax is defined by the data source.
- `name` (String) The name of the filter

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description of the filter
- `owners` (Set of String) User id of the owners of this filter
- `state` (String) The state of the filter Possible values are: ["Active", "Inactive"]
- `table` (String) The full name of the table that should be filtered
- `who` (Attributes Set) The who-items associated with the filter. When this is not set (nil), the who-list will not be overridden. This is typically used when this should be managed from Raito Cloud. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--who))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the filter

<a id="nestedatt--who"></a>
### Nested Schema for `who`

Optional:

- `access_control` (String) The ID of the access control in Raito Cloud. Cannot be set if `user` or `group` is set.
- `group` (String) The ID of the group in Raito Cloud. This cannot be set if `user` or `access_control` is set.
- `promise_duration` (Number) Specify this to indicate that this who-item is a promise instead of a direct grant. This is specified as the number of seconds that access should be granted when requested.
- `user` (String) The email address of user. This cannot be set if `group` or `access_control` is set.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
#Import grant. Not that who and what_data_objects will not be imported
terraform import raito_filter.example filterId
```
