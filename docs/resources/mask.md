## Schema

### Required

- `data_source` (String) The ID of the data source of the mask

- `columns` (Set of String) The full name of columns that should be included in the mask. Items are managed by Raito Cloud if columns is not set (nil).
- `description` (String) The description of the mask
- `owners` (Set of String) User id of the owners of this mask
- `state` (String) The state of the mask Possible values are: ["Active", "Inactive"]
- `type` (String) The masking method, which defines how the data is masked. Available types are defined by the data source.
- `who` (Attributes Set) The who-items associated with the mask. When this is not set (nil), the who-list will not be overridden. This is typically used when this should be managed from Raito Cloud. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--who))

- `access_control` (String) The ID of the access control in Raito Cloud. Cannot be set if `user` or `group` is set.
- `group` (String) The ID of the group in Raito Cloud. This cannot be set if `user` or `access_control` is set.
- `promise_duration` (Number) Specify this to indicate that this who-item is a promise instead of a direct grant. This is specified as the number of seconds that access should be granted when requested.
- `user` (String) The email address of user. This cannot be set if `group` or `access_control` is set.
